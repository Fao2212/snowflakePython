# The following code to create a dataframe and remove duplicated rows is always executed and acts as a preamble for your script: 

# dataset = pandas.DataFrame(QUANTITY_OF_ITEMS_SOLD, UNIT_PRICE)
# dataset = dataset.drop_duplicates()

# Paste or type your script code here:

#import seaborn as sns

#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#hm = sns.heatmap(dataset.corr(),annot= True)
#plt.show()
